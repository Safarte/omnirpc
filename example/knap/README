Knapsack problem: a sample program using OmniRpc in OpenMP

-- How to build

 - Before building the application, install OmniRpc
 - Make clients
      % make
 - Make remote executables and register them
      % make reg_stub

-- Clients

  knap -- squential version
  knap-par -- OpenMP version
  knap-rpc -- OmniRpc version 
  knap-prpc -- OmniRpc version in OpenMP
  knap1-rpc -- OmniRpc version with OmniRpcInitModule
  knap1-prpc -- OmniRpc version with OmniRpcInitModule in OpenMP

-- How to run

  To run, squential version
     % knap <object_data_file> <#subtree>

  To run OpenMP versions, set environment variable OMP_NUM_THEADS to specify
  the number of OpenMP threads.
    
  Before OmniRpc version, make sure your environment setting such as hosts.xml
  
  The argument is the same as the sequential version, like
     % <client> <object_data_file> <#subtree>
